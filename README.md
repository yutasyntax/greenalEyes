## GreenalEyes

GreenalEyes is a web app that lets you analyze vegetation coverage anywhere in the world. Just select a location on the mapâ€”the app fetches satellite imagery and uses computer vision to calculate how much of the area is covered in green vegetation.
This tool was developed as part of a personal project focused on urban greening.

## Features
- Select any location interactively on the map
- Retrieve satellite imagery of the selected area
- Analyze vegetation coverage using OpenCV-based green pixel detection
- Display green coverage percentage
- Visualize results with a heatmap overlay

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Main application file containing the Streamlit logic and UI components
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python packages
- `.streamlit/`: Configuration directory for Streamlit
- `.gitignore`: Excludes unnecessary or sensitive files (e.g. `.idea/`)
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yutasyntax/greenalEyes.git`  
   `cd greenalEyes`

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   `python -m venv venv`  
   `source venv/bin/activate`  *(On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`)*

3. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the Streamlit app:  
   `streamlit run main.py`
